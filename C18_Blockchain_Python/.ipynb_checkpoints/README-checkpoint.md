## Overview

Blockchain is an online application that allows our users to build a blockchain ledger system. While Python was used for the back-end code, Streamlit enhances the front-end user experience. This ledger allows the user to conduct financial transactions and validate the blockchain. 

---

## Requirements


This project leverages python 3.7 and Streamlit.

A [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment with liabraries listed below and [Jupyter Notebook/Lab](https://jupyter.org/) are required to run the code.

The following library was used:

2. [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.


Install the following librarie(s) in your terminal...

    pip install streamlit

## User Experience

Go to the Anaconda Prompt to launch JupyterLab by typing Jupyter Lab. To use this application simply clone the repository and run the pychain.py in your Jupyter Lab. Open a terminal and input streamlit run pychain.py or simply choose from the two options below.

Please experience Blockchain for yourself. Choose between the following... 

1) CLICK https://share.streamlit.io/jcsung-star/blockchain_ledger/main/pychain.py

2) SCAN the QR Reader using the camera from your phone.
