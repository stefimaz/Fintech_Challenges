## Overview

pychain.py is an application that allows the user to build a blockchain ledger. While Python was used for the back-end code, Streamlit enhances the front-end user experience. This ledger allows the user to conduct financial transactions and validate them to the blockchain. 

---

## Requirements


This project leverages python 3.7 and Streamlit.

A [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment with liabraries listed below and [Jupyter Notebook/Lab](https://jupyter.org/) are required to run the code.

The following library was used:

2. [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.


Install the following librarie(s) in your terminal...

    pip install streamlit
