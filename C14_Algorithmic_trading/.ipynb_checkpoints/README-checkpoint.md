## Overview [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


The program was designed to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firmâ€™s competitive advantage in the market. In order to enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data, the following was accomplished...

* Establish a Baseline Performance

* Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm

* Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier

* Create an Evaluation Report

## Requirements

This project leverages python 3.7 and scikit-learn.

A [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment with liabraries listed below and [Jupyter Notebook/Lab](https://jupyter.org/) are required to run the code.

The following library was used:

1. [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - Scikit Learn or Sklearn is one of the most used Python libraries for Data Science, along with others like Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, or Keras.


Install the following librarie(s) in your terminal...

    pip install -U scikit-learn

## Data

The data used in this neural network model was from derived from a CSV file called emerging_markets_ohlcv.csv:

## Evaluation Report

### Alternative ML Model and Evaluate Strategy Returns

#### Step 1: Tune the training algorithm by adjusting the size of the training dataset:

#### Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?

By increasing the training window, we have a better accuracy for the 6 months period as well as bigger returns at the end of the trading period.

we can also see that the spread between the actual returns and the strategy returns is wilder or more volatile. Meaning that at some point in the timeframe the strategy returns are much worst and at other much better. This suggest that increasing the window period increase the risk. 

But it seems that that risk can be mitigated by going with a much longer period for training the model. as the 18 months period shows. 

Also, by decreasing the window to 1 month, we get a more stable strategy that keep the same accuracy. This window also shows less risk as the strategy projection always stays above the actual returns and there is much less negative volatility and less risk.

#### Step 2: Tune the trading algorithm by adjusting the SMA input features.

#### Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?

After testing different SMA windows, the better returns is using a short window of 4 and long window of 150.

### Backtesting a new model to evaluate its performance:

When staying with the initial 3 months period for training the model, using the AdaBooster Classifier gives the better end results compare to the other classifiers.

![cumulative_return_plot](Images/Adaboost_fig.png)

#### Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model?

THe model using AdaBoost perform better if look at the final day of traiding. It return a slightly higher profit than the original model with the 3 months training period. 
 

#### Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm? 

This model using AdaBooster did not take the SMA window change well at all and is now returning worst than the actual returns.

But, the model that performed the best with the window changed to 6 month and the short window SMA at 4 and long window SMA at 150 is now the Decision Tree Classifier. This model gives much better final results then all of them.
