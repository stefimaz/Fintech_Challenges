## Overview [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


The program was designed to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firmâ€™s competitive advantage in the market. In order to enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data, the following was accomplished...

* Establish a Baseline Performance

* Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm

* Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier

* Create an Evaluation Report

---

## Requirements

This project leverages python 3.7 and scikit-learn.

A [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment with liabraries listed below and [Jupyter Notebook/Lab](https://jupyter.org/) are required to run the code.

The following library was used:

1. [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - Scikit Learn or Sklearn is one of the most used Python libraries for Data Science, along with others like Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, or Keras.


Install the following librarie(s) in your terminal...

    pip install -U scikit-learn

## Data

The data used in this neural network model was from derived from a CSV file called emerging_markets_ohlcv.csv:

## Visualization

Cumulative return plot that shows the actual returns vs. the strategy returns. 

Orignial window was 3 months.

## Evaluation Report

### Alternative ML Model and Evaluate Strategy Returns

#### Step 1: Tune the training algorithm by adjusting the size of the training dataset:

Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?

By increasing the window, we have a better accuracy for the 6 months period but worst for the 9 months period. we can also see that the spread between the actual and the strategy returns is wilder. Meaning that at some point in the timeframe the strategy returns are much worst and at other much better. This suggest that increasing the window period increse the risk.

But by decreasing the window to 1 month, we get a more stable strategy that keep the same accuracy. This window also shows less risk as the strategy projection always stays above the actual returns.

#### Step 2: Tune the trading algorithm by adjusting the SMA input features.

Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?


### Side note

so far best is adabooster with 1 month window and SMA of 4 and 50

### Backtesting a new model to evaluate its performance:

Using the Logistic Regression Classifier gives the better results compare to the other classifiers.
![cumulative_return_plot](Images/Logisticreg_fig.png)

Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model?

This new model performed better in the long run. But it also present more risk compare to the provided baseline model.  

Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm? 

The model performed the best with the window changed to 1 month and the SMA long changed to 50 (no changed in SMA short)
